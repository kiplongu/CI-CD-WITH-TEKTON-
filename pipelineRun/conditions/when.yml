# Using the when Field
# Tekton's when field enables conditional execution of Tasks, allowing you to control when a Task runs based on specific conditions.

# The three components for the when expression are input, operator, and values.

# input: The input to the when condition can either be a static input or variable (parameters from pipelines or results from previous tasks). If an input is not provided, it defaults to an empty string.
# operator: The relationship between input and a set of values. The valid operator can be either in or notin. (Not-in)
# values: An array of string values which must be provided and should be non-empty. It can contain static values or variables (parameters, results, or a workspace's bound state).
